# Raster pixels and histograms

The pixel picker reads the raster value at a point. Histograms describe a
distribution over the selected area. Both use Catalog source data, independently
of map colors or whether GeoServer can draw the raster. Transparent valid pixels
still count as data.

One map click can return both vector features and raster information. The click
summary reports these separately and lets you switch between them. Automatic
histograms use the top two visible rasters. Histogram results describe the sampling
area, not just the clicked pixel or the features returned by feature inspection.

## Plot values across raster layers

Choose **Plot raster stack** beneath a histogram or in the map's **More** menu.
**Raster series** uses your last map click; if you have not clicked yet, it
prompts you to click the map. Visible raster layers start selected. Expand
**Rasters** to choose a different set, including layers hidden on the map.

Each raster is one position on the x-axis. Choose map-layer or natural
layer-name order, reverse that order, and switch between line and scatter plots.
This compares the source pixel at the same geographic point in each raster;
it does not align or resample the raster grids. Compare compatible measurements:
the chart does not convert units between layers.

Select up to 50 rasters per plot. Two pixel requests run at a time and values
appear as they arrive. A new map click cancels the previous requests while this
tool is active. The previous plot is faded until new values arrive. Closing or
switching away stops unfinished reads; reopening a finished plot reuses its values.

**Values & download** lists every selected raster, including NoData, outside
coverage and failed reads. Missing values leave gaps in the plot and are never
replaced with zero. **Download CSV** saves the completed table with full numerical
precision, catalog identities, click coordinates and result status. Plot choices
are retained while the page is open; they are not included in shared map links.

## Choose an area

Use **Sampling area** to choose a map box or a filtered
[Catalog vector](vector-sampling.md). Use **Whole raster** for a global 1D
distribution or **Whole overlap** for a [2D comparison](bivariate-raster.md).
Polygon masks preserve holes and count overlapping features once.

The map box defaults to 200 km. Its slider and integer-kilometer input allow up
to 14,152 km. This is a geometry limit: position-specific pole and date-line
checks still apply. An unsupported selection leaves the previous box intact.
Resizing retains the selected center.

## Exact versus sampled results

A large sampling area does not mean every source pixel is read. EOLab reports
which of these methods produced the histogram:

- **Exact bounded distribution:** reads the selected source envelope when its
  edges are at most 512 pixels, it intersects at most 1,024 native blocks, and
  decoded values plus validity need at most 64 MiB.
- **Approximate sampled distribution:** uses one center observation per grid cell,
  with at most 127 cells along the longest edge. It prefers a suitable embedded
  COG overview. Without one, reading is limited to 16,129 native blocks and 9 GiB
  cumulative decoded source work; only a bounded block is retained at a time.

These limits are fixed. A request that cannot fit them fails instead of starting
an unrestricted read. Histogram polygon masks use all-touched inclusion on the
chosen grid. A sampled distribution may miss small or rare features and its
extremes need not be the full raster's extremes. Use native
[raster calculations](raster-calculations.md) for counts, sums and ground area.

## Reading the chart

The 1D histogram has 64 bins. The x-axis shows raster values; the y-axis shows
each bin's percentage of **valid sampled pixels**. Hover details give bin bounds
and counts. Each chart has its own percentage scale, so equal bar heights on
different charts do not necessarily represent equal percentages.

NoData and non-finite values are excluded, not treated as zero. Units are shown
only when provided by the raster's band metadata. Very large or small values may
use scientific notation or a labeled axis offset. Suggested style ranges use
the sampled 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles; styling does not alter source values.

The analysis reader requires a supported single numeric band, valid CRS and
affine georeferencing, and native block edges no larger than 1,024 pixels.
Georeferencing, nodata and overviews must be embedded in the GeoTIFF. External
masks/overviews/auxiliary files, alpha masks and per-dataset input masks are not
accepted. Prepare a self-contained source upstream if those checks fail.

## Busy or unavailable results

Moving or changing a selection cancels obsolete requests. An already-running
native read may finish its current block before stopping. Capacity conflicts
retry briefly; a persistent error offers **Retry**. Cataloged rasters are immutable;
analysis does not poll file metadata for changes. Failure to draw the optional vector outline does
not invalidate its analysis area.

### Reusing raster summary results

Completed raster-calculator values are cached in PostgreSQL for up to 24 hours,
shared by viewers connected to the same EOLab database. The UI identifies these
as **Reused cached result**. A reused value gets its own job and CSV download
with the current statistic title and formula; it does not inherit another
session's download permissions or execution timings.

The match includes the immutable catalog raster, source metadata, exact area
or vector filter, parsed formula, requested batch size and calculation-policy
version. Titles and formula
whitespace do not affect matching. Different filters with the same bounding
box remain different areas. Algebraically equivalent formulas and reordered
filter rules are not automatically considered identical.

Source authorization, queue admission and cancellation still apply. The cache
lookup runs before polygon-envelope reads and raster size estimation. A hit skips
those planning steps, the large-calculation confirmation, raster reads and
polygon-mask creation. The small cached values are copied into the prepared job,
so cache expiry while it waits cannot unexpectedly start a full calculation.
An uncached request goes through the usual planning and confirmation. When a request groups several formulas, all must be cached; otherwise
the normal combined calculation runs. Separate deployments with separate
databases do not share values.

The Processing limits `calculation_cache_capacity` (default 1,000) and
`calculation_cache_ttl_seconds` (default 86,400) configure this cache in Python,
like the other Processing limits. A zero capacity disables reads and writes.
Payloads are limited to 32 KiB each; expired entries and oldest entries beyond
capacity are removed when results are added. Deleting an owned job removes its
download, not the independently cached numerical values. Cache entries contain
no user titles, raster pixels, polygon geometry, source paths or download links.
