# Deployment and operations

This guide is for the person creating or maintaining an EOLab workspace. The
main [README](../README.md) explains how participants use the application.

## What a deployment contains

The supplied Docker Compose stack runs:

- the EOLab web application;
- PostgreSQL with pgSTAC for persistent Catalog metadata;
- the STAC API for Catalog queries;
- GeoServer for raster and vector rendering;
- a Processing worker for raster calculations and clip downloads;
- a Job service for vector-area measurements and optional map outlines; and
- one-time database migration and GeoServer initialization services.

Source datasets are supplied through a read-only host bind mount. EOLab does
not copy the source files into its database or modify them in place.

## Before you deploy

Prepare:

1. a machine with Docker Compose, or a Coolify project that can deploy a Docker
   Compose repository;
2. different, long random secrets for PostgreSQL, the GeoServer administrator,
   the GeoServer keystore, and the Job service; and
3. an absolute host directory containing the prepared datasets, readable by
   the application container.

Keep the database password stable after the first deployment. PostgreSQL uses
it when initializing the persistent database volume; changing only the
environment variable later does not change the existing database role's
password.

Raster files should already be georeferenced and prepared for interactive map
delivery. Tiled, overviewed, single-band Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs in Web
Mercator (EPSG:3857) are recommended for the default map. EOLab publishes
mounted rasters as-is and reports reader or CRS failures instead of rewriting
the source.

## Required configuration

Start from [`.env.example`](../.env.example), which is the authoritative list
of settings and defaults. At minimum, set:

```text
EOLAB_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<long random value>
EOLAB_GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<different long random value>
EOLAB_GEOSERVER_MASTER_PASSWORD=<different long random value>
EOLAB_JOBS_TOKEN=<different long random URL-safe value>
EOLAB_SCAN_MOUNT_PATH=/absolute/host/path/to/data
EOLAB_SCAN_PATHS_WITHIN_MOUNT=["."]
EOLAB_SCAN_DISPLAY_PATH_PREFIX=Workshop data
```

`EOLAB_SCAN_MOUNT_PATH` is a path on the deployment host. Compose mounts it
inside the application at `/scan-source` as read-only. Each entry in
`EOLAB_SCAN_PATHS_WITHIN_MOUNT` is relative to that root; use `.` to scan the
entire mount. `EOLAB_SCAN_DISPLAY_PATH_PREFIX` is the friendly location shown
to users in Item details.

The GeoServer administrator password must contain at least 16 letters,
numbers, hyphens, underscores, or periods. The master password must contain at
least eight characters, have no surrounding whitespace, and differ from the
administrator password.

Generate the Jobs token with
`python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"` and set the single
`EOLAB_JOBS_TOKEN` variable. Compose passes it to both the app and Job service.
The app rejects absent, blank or malformed tokens at startup. Keep it private;
see [Job service operation](job-service.md) for a manual diagnostic.

Set nonblank `EOLAB_APP_TITLE` and `EOLAB_APP_SUBTITLE` values for the public
application identity. In Coolify, use the `EOLAB_` variable names from the example;
Compose maps them to the internal container names.

Use distinct persistent volume names when several EOLab deployments share one
Docker host:

```text
EOLAB_DATABASE_VOLUME_NAME=my-workshop-pgstac
EOLAB_GEOSERVER_DATA_VOLUME_NAME=my-workshop-geoserver
EOLAB_PROCESSING_DATA_VOLUME_NAME=my-workshop-processing
```

## Basemap choices

The **Basemap** dropdown sits at the lower-right of the map, above attribution.
**Detailed** uses `EOLAB_BASEMAP_URL` and `EOLAB_BASEMAP_ATTRIBUTION`, and is selected
when the app opens. **Country outlines** uses bundled Natural Earth boundaries.
**None** removes the background. These choices do not change data layers,
map position, sampling, or analysis results. The choice lasts for the open map;
it is not included in saved-map links or browser-local saved views.

To offer **Light (CARTO)**, set this optional deployment variable and redeploy:

```text
EOLAB_CARTO_BASEMAP_API_KEY=<your CARTO basemap key>
```

When the variable is missing or blank, the CARTO choice is absent. Compose passes
it as `CARTO_BASEMAP_API_KEY` inside the app container. The app includes it in
the public tile URL because the browser requests tiles directly. Use a
domain-restricted **basemap** key, not a private CARTO account credential.
Request a key and configure restrictions using
[CARTO's basemap key page](https://carto.com/basemaps/apikey/).
CARTO/OSM attribution stays visible while that background is selected.
CARTO documents that its raster tile service is being retired; this optional
Leaflet raster integration can be disabled by clearing the key. No additional
renderer is required by EOLab.

To offer **Satellite (MapTiler)**, set `EOLAB_MAPTILER_API_KEY` and redeploy.
Missing or blank hides the option. Compose passes it as `MAPTILER_API_KEY` to
the app container. Use a map-access key from
[MapTiler Cloud](https://cloud.maptiler.com/account/keys/), restricted to the
viewer domains. This key is browser-visible; it is not a private account token.
The browser requests `satellite-v2` JPEG tiles directly from MapTiler only when
selected. This is imagery without road or place labels. Native tiles are used
through zoom 22, as advertised by the provider's TileJSON metadata.

MapTiler/OSM attribution and a linked MapTiler logo remain visible while Satellite
is selected, including the logo required by free accounts. Usage counts against
the supplied key's account plan and quota. If imagery cannot load, the basemap
control shows a message; check allowed domains, key validity, quota and network
access. Switching to another basemap and back retries the tile requests.
See [MapTiler attribution requirements](https://docs.maptiler.com/guides/map-design/attribution/add-attribution/).

The outline asset is Natural Earth **1:110m Admin 0 Countries**, version 5.1.2,
[public-domain data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/).
`frontend/src/assets/country-outlines.geojson` retains the coordinates of all
177 features and removes their unused attributes. Source:
[`ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geojson`](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/blob/v5.1.2/geojson/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geojson).
Source SHA-256: `6866c877d39cba9c357620878839b336d569f8c662d3cfab4cb1dbe2d39c977f`.
These generalized boundaries are a display background, not analysis geometry.
They load from EOLab on first selection and need no external tile service.

## Deploy with Coolify

1. Create a resource from this repository.
2. Select the **Docker Compose** build pack and `/docker-compose.yml`.
3. Add the required variables above to the intended Coolify environment.
   `EOLAB_SCAN_MOUNT_PATH` must be added manually because it is a bind-mount
   source rather than a container variable.
4. Attach the public domain only to the `app` service at internal port `8000`,
   for example `https://eolab.example.com:8000`. Keep the other services private;
   EOLab provides the public Catalog, rendering and Jobs API routes.
5. In **Advanced**, enable **Include Source Commit in Build** (called **Source
   Commit Availability** in some Coolify versions). This lets the application
   display the deployed Git-derived version.
6. Deploy the resource.

Changing an environment variable requires a redeployment. Persistent Catalog
and GeoServer volumes survive an ordinary redeployment.

## Run locally

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, set the required values, and start the stack:

```console
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build --detach
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. The local override exposes GeoServer's
administration interface only on the same machine at
`http://localhost:8081/geoserver/web/`; sign in as `eolab` with
`EOLAB_GEOSERVER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## First-run verification

After the application reports that its services are ready:

1. Open **Status** and run **Scan directories** from the Catalog section.
2. Confirm that the configured user-facing paths appear and the scan completes.
3. Search for and add one representative raster and vector.
4. Verify **Zoom to**, styling, map clicking, and a raster histogram.
5. In the browser network inspector, reload one map tile twice and verify its
   `geowebcache-cache-result` response changes from `MISS` to `HIT`, with both
   `geowebcache-gridset` and `geowebcache-crs` reporting `EPSG:3857`.
6. Open **Rendering diagnostics** while changing zoom levels and check for
   repeated `GetMap` failures, queue saturation, or sustained heap pressure.
7. Copy a map link and open it in another browser tab to verify shared-view
   restoration.
8. Select a small filtered polygon, confirm its outline, and calculate a raster
   mean. Create and download a small clip to verify the Processing artifact mount.

Scanning is repeatable. It creates or updates stable Catalog Items for mounted
datasets and removes Items whose required mounted files no longer exist. A
failure in one dataset is reported without preventing unrelated valid files
from being cataloged.

## Supported mounted data

The scanner recognizes GeoTIFF, GeoPackage, mounted Shapefile, ZIP-contained
Shapefile, GeoJSON FeatureCollection, and Esri File Geodatabase sources.
Mounted GeoTIFFs, mounted Shapefiles, and spatial GeoPackage layers are the
current map-rendering paths. Other recognized vector formats remain useful as
Catalog records and report an actionable message when rendering is unsupported.

The scanner is metadata-oriented. It does not validate raster tiling,
overviews, compression, decoded size, or GeoServer reader compatibility. Data
preparation remains an upstream responsibility.

GeoPackage and File Geodatabase containers can produce one Catalog item per
spatial layer; nonspatial tables are skipped. A bad layer is reported separately
when other layers can be cataloged. GeoJSON must be a FeatureCollection with
WGS84 longitude/latitude coordinates; projected legacy CRS declarations are not
silently reprojected.

GeoPackage layers whose transformed geographic bounds cross the date line can
be cataloged. Their catalog footprint is split at +/-180 degrees while the
source geometry and native CRS remain unchanged. On the single-world map,
zooming to such a layer shows both map edges; feature inspection checks both
longitude intervals. The footprint remains a conservative envelope, not the
exact union of the source polygons. Rescan a previously rejected source after
upgrading. This does not add support for every analysis operation on unsplit
date-line-crossing source polygons.

## Capacity controls

Begin with the defaults in `.env.example` and change them only after observing
the deployed workload. The main controls are:

| Setting | Default | What it bounds |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `EOLAB_GEOSERVER_CPU_LIMIT` | `4` | CPUs available to GeoServer |
| `EOLAB_GEOSERVER_MAX_HEAP_SIZE` | `4g` | GeoServer Java heap |
| `EOLAB_GEOSERVER_WMS_RENDER_COUNT` | `2` | Concurrent WMS renders |
| `EOLAB_GEOSERVER_GWC_REQUEST_COUNT` | `8` | Concurrent cached-tile requests, including misses |
| `EOLAB_GEOSERVER_WMS_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `10` | Seconds a render may wait for capacity |
| `EOLAB_GEOWEBCACHE_DISK_QUOTA_GIB` | `25` | Persistent tile-cache size before LRU cleanup |
| `EOLAB_COMPOSITE_TILE_CACHE_BYTES` | `134217728` | Process-local successful composite PNG response bytes |
| `EOLAB_MAP_RENDER_QUEUE_CAPACITY` | `64` | Additional distinct composite misses and direct WMS GetMap requests waiting per app process; `0` disables waiting |
| `EOLAB_MAP_RENDER_QUEUE_WAIT_SECONDS` | `60` | Maximum wait before upstream dispatch, greater than zero and at most 60 seconds |
| `EOLAB_RASTER_PIXEL_READ_CONCURRENCY` | `2` | Concurrent interactive pixel reads |
| `EOLAB_RASTER_STATISTICS_READ_CONCURRENCY` | `1` | Concurrent bounded statistics reads |
| `EOLAB_RASTER_STATISTICS_QUEUE_CAPACITY` | `32` | Additional distinct 1D/2D histogram reads waiting per app process |
| `EOLAB_RASTER_STATISTICS_QUEUE_WAIT_SECONDS` | `30` | Maximum wait before a histogram read starts, excluding read time |
| `EOLAB_RASTER_STATISTICS_MAX_WAITERS` | `256` | Callers awaiting histogram results per app process, including duplicate requests |
| `EOLAB_SCAN_WORKER_COUNT` | `8` | Concurrent metadata workers |
| `EOLAB_SCAN_WRITER_COUNT` | `4` | Concurrent Catalog bulk writes |
| `EOLAB_SCAN_BATCH_SIZE` | `100` | Items in each bulk write |

Composite cache misses and direct WMS GetMap requests share one FIFO queue per
app process, using `EOLAB_GEOSERVER_WMS_RENDER_COUNT` upstream slots. Successful
composite cache hits bypass the queue; identical composite misses share one
queued or running request. The default allows 64 additional requests to wait up
to 60 seconds, followed by at most 30 seconds for the upstream response. Configure
the reverse proxy to allow this combined wait. Full or expired queues return 503
with `Retry-After: 1`; the upstream execution deadline returns 504. GeoServer's
own admission limit remains a final guard for traffic outside this app process.
Use one app process per GeoServer with these limits; independent replicas do not
share this queue or its cache.

Disconnecting removes unused queued work. A started HTTP request keeps its slot
until its response or deadline, even after its last viewer leaves, because closing
the connection does not prove GeoServer stopped rendering. At timeout or shutdown
the transport is cancelled; native GeoServer work may continue. Capabilities,
feature picking and diagnostics do not wait in the GetMap queue. Frontend tile
loading/recovery feedback is independent of this server-side scheduling.

Ordinary and paired histograms share a FIFO queue in each app process. Identical
requests share one read; cached results bypass the queue. The defaults permit one
active read, 32 additional distinct reads, and 256 waiting callers (including
duplicates). Canceling the last caller drops queued work; an active reader holds
its capacity until it actually exits. Hover pixel picking uses separate capacity.

A full backlog or waiter limit returns 409 `statistics_capacity_busy`; the browser
retries that response up to five times, then offers Retry. A request waiting more
than 30 seconds returns 503 `statistics_queue_timeout` and offers manual Retry.
Both responses include `Retry-After`. The wait limit excludes raster reading;
configure the reverse proxy's response timeout to allow queue wait plus the read.
Info logs separate `queue_wait_seconds` from `read_seconds` (the latter includes
selection rechecks and result caching). These limits are per process, not per user,
and increasing the queue does not increase native execution concurrency.

Vector filter counts use two readers per app process, with up to 32 requests
waiting in FIFO order for at most 30 seconds. The wait is separate from the
existing 21-second read deadline and one-million-feature scan limit. These are
the Vector publication service's constructor defaults. Cached counts and filter
application bypass the count queue. Disconnecting removes a waiting request;
an active read keeps its slot until the reader exits after cancellation.

The `/api/vector-rendering/filter-counts` endpoint returns 429
`filter_count_queue_full` or 503 `filter_count_queue_timeout` in `detail.category`,
with `Retry-After: 2`. The layer stays filtered and displays a message to apply
the filter again to retry counting; the browser does not retry indefinitely.
A successful response with `complete: false` still means the reader could not
provide an exact count, rather than ordinary queue contention. Allow at least
the combined queue and read deadlines in proxy response timeouts.

EOLab abandons queued upstream `GetMap` work when the requesting browser
disconnects, but an already-running GeoServer render may not stop immediately.
Increasing concurrency beyond the storage and CPU available can make latency
worse rather than better.

Source rasters stored in EPSG:3857 avoid reprojection on cache misses; GeoServer
can still reproject other supported CRSs. GeoWebCache tiles live in the persistent
GeoServer volume and are removed least-recently-used first when its quota is
reached. Composite map images use a separate process-local cache, cleared by an
application restart. A new image does not invalidate old persisted tiles: after
a rendering fix, truncate affected layers' GeoWebCache tiles if stale colors
remain, including old NoData colors.

See [clip limits](raster-clips.md#storage-and-limits),
[calculation limits](raster-calculations.md#limits) and
[Jobs limits](job-service.md#lifecycle-and-limits) for the separate processing budgets.

## Processing storage and recovery

The named Processing volume is mounted at `/processing-data`, writable by
`processing-worker` and read-only in the app. Keep it outside the source mount.
The 20 GiB reservation budget does not allocate or cap the underlying disk;
monitor host/volume free space. Processing also requires a 2 GiB free-space floor.
Deleting this volume loses result files even if their database records remain.
Back up persistent database and result storage together when results must be kept.

Deploy the app and Processing worker together. Current Catalog-vector jobs require
worker claim protocol 5; older workers cannot claim them. Before rolling back to
code that cannot read these job formats, finish or cancel the affected jobs and
remove them through the supported API. Do not drop compatibility database triggers.
An old unsubmitted upload plan can report `legacy_selection_plan`; choose a Catalog
vector and make a new plan. Completed results retain their usual expiry.

A graceful worker stop interrupts its active job. After an abrupt worker failure,
the queue can wait about ten minutes for the previous execution deadline before
starting another attempt. Interrupted jobs require a new plan/job; partial results
are not resumed. App health and map exploration can remain available while
Processing reports its database or storage unavailable.

Job updates use same-origin server-sent events with a two-second polling fallback.
Allow streaming through the reverse proxy without buffering. Losing that stream
does not cancel accepted jobs. The stream reconnects periodically; polling still
recovers updates if streaming is unavailable.

Raster calculation and clip planning share a FIFO queue with one native planner.
The current limits admit 32 unfinished requests, retain 128 plan records, and
allow each browser session 32 unfinished or ready plans. This admits a burst of
independent raster plans from one session within the existing global queue;
it does not add native workers or limit a map to 32 rasters. Tabs sharing the
Processing session cookie share this allowance, including calculation and clip
plans. A 64-raster area series still processes all 64: requests beyond current
capacity stay pending in the browser and retry automatically as space opens.
Released plans no longer count against the
session allowance, but remain in the 128-record budget until expiry so that
late retries cannot recreate cancelled work. A cache hit still
checks source access but does not wait for the native planner. Queue waiting has
its own 60-second limit; active planning retains its 15-second limit. A completed
estimate is usable for five minutes starting when preparation finishes.

New browser clients submit to `POST /api/processing/raster-calculations/plans/{id}`
or `/api/processing/raster-clips/plans/{id}`, using a random 32-character lowercase
hex ID. A 202 response contains the current state; `GET /api/processing/plans/{id}`
returns progress and the completed estimate. Reusing an ID with the same inputs
recovers an uncertain submission. Changing its inputs returns `plan_conflict`.
`DELETE /api/processing/plans/{id}` cancels queued/active planning or releases a
ready estimate. Cancellation remains visible until native cleanup finishes;
another request cannot take its active slot early. Status is owner-scoped, with
the existing SSE change hints and two-second polling fallback.

The older singular `/plan` endpoints still return completed estimates, waiting
on this same queue. Deploy the API before serving the new frontend bundle, or
deploy them together. A graceful app shutdown cancels preparation; after an
abrupt stop an abandoned request reports `planning_interrupted` within its stored
deadline (at most 100 seconds under current limits). It is not replayed: retry
with a new ID. `plan_queue_full` means the pending queue filled, while
`plan_record_capacity` means retained records or the session limit filled.
These limits apply to planning; execution-job admission has separate limits.
The browser automatically retries `plan_queue_full` and `plan_record_capacity`,
and starts a new plan after `plan_queue_timeout`. Calculation submissions retry
`owner_queue_full` and `queue_full` with the same request key. These waits are
cancellable, honor `Retry-After`, and back off from 5 to 30 seconds plus jitter;
longer server retry delays take precedence. Retained-input, result-storage and
job-history exhaustion remain explicit errors requiring attention.

### Durable calculation and clip queues

Execution uses one global worker lane. Waiting jobs do not occupy that lane, and
the running job does not count against its session's waiting allowance. The
worker selects the least recently served session, then that session's oldest
queued job. A session without an earlier execution start goes first; ties use
the oldest queued job. Each start counts as a turn even if execution fails or is
cancelled. Running work is never preempted, so another session can still wait
up to the current job's execution deadline. This shares turns, not CPU seconds.
Queued inputs and scheduling history survive restarts. Deploy the app and worker
together: an older worker still uses the former FIFO policy. The migration counts
existing inputs; a database trigger also accounts for inserts and cleanup by older
versions during rollout.

The defaults admit a burst of 32 jobs from one session plus four jobs each from
twelve other sessions (80 waiting jobs), provided storage budgets also fit.
`tests/test_processing_admission_postgres.py` exercises that workload with a held
execution lane, then checks session turns and FIFO order within each session.
Raising the backlog limits does not add workers or make individual jobs faster.

Set these deployment variables in Coolify or `.env`; Compose supplies the same
values without the `EOLAB_` prefix to the app and worker. Blank or invalid values
fail startup. Omitted values use the defaults below.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `EOLAB_PROCESSING_MAX_WAITING_JOBS` | 128 | Global queued jobs, excluding running/cancelling work |
| `EOLAB_PROCESSING_MAX_OWNER_WAITING_JOBS` | 32 | Queued jobs per browser session |
| `EOLAB_PROCESSING_MAX_JOB_RECORDS` | 4096 | All job records, including retained results and idempotency records |
| `EOLAB_PROCESSING_MAX_JOB_INPUT_BYTES` | 134217728 | JSON bytes reserved for job specifications and summaries until cleanup |
| `EOLAB_PROCESSING_MAX_STORED_BYTES` | 21474836480 | Artifact/scratch disk reservations, unchanged 20 GiB default |
| `EOLAB_PROCESSING_FREE_SPACE_FLOOR_BYTES` | 2147483648 | Physical free space to leave unused; zero disables the floor |
| `EOLAB_PROCESSING_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 600 | Maximum duration of an executing job, excluding queue wait |
| `EOLAB_PROCESSING_RESULT_TTL_SECONDS` | 86400 | Result lifetime starting at completion |

Counts, durations and byte limits must be positive integers (the free-space
floor may be zero; durations cannot exceed one year). Pending input reservations
remain held after cancellation until cleanup succeeds. Small summaries and idempotency records remain bounded
by the record limit after input payloads are removed. Cleaned terminal records
expire after seven days; recent request keys remain recoverable even when new
admission is full. Deleting a result releases its input/artifact reservations
after cleanup, but does not immediately discard its idempotency record.

Submission returns distinct 429 error codes: `owner_queue_full` for the session's
waiting allowance, `queue_full` for the global backlog, `job_record_capacity` for
retained records, `job_input_capacity` for retained input bytes, and `storage_full`
for artifact reservations. These are finite overload limits, not an indication
that the one worker is merely busy. Existing accepted IDs/status/results and
cancellation routes are unchanged. A cached calculation still needs its own
bounded job record and download reservation.

At INFO level, app admission logs report waiting jobs/sessions, session allowance,
record/input usage and artifact reservations. Worker claim logs report remaining
backlog and that job's queue wait. They include no session identities or source
inputs. Existing calculation timing continues to separate queue and execution.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| App fails with a blank-setting error | Required Coolify variables, including title/subtitle and Jobs token; save and redeploy after editing. |
| Scan progress says status is unavailable | Use **Retry status check**. A failed status request does not mean the server scan stopped; do not submit another scan just to recover observation. |
| Raster reader or CRS rejection | Prepare a compatible georeferenced GeoTIFF upstream, rescan, and retry. |
| Rendering connectivity/authentication error | GeoServer health and matching deployment credentials. |
| Rendering configuration error | GeoServer initialization logs and workspace/layer resources; ambiguous partial resources are preserved for administrator inspection. |
| Polygon outline unavailable | Jobs logs, token, Catalog connection and read-only source mount; numeric analysis is independent of the outline. |
| Processing admission or disk-space refusal | Active jobs, result retention and free disk space; wait, cancel unnecessary work or delete finished exports. |
| Vector source changed | Rescan the vector and select it again; accepted jobs require unchanged original vector sources. |

## Build information

The application image targets Linux amd64 and Python 3.12. Pinned runtime wheels
and their hashes are in `deployment/application-runtime-requirements.txt`; build
tools are in `deployment/application-build-requirements.txt`.

The OGR Python bindings are the explicit source-build exception:
`deployment/application-gdal-requirements.txt` pins the GDAL 3.10.3 source archive
and SHA-256. A separate Docker stage builds it with the pinned Python/NumPy build
inputs and Debian `libgdal-dev=3.10.3+dfsg-1`; runtime uses the matching
`libgdal36` version. Compilers and development headers stay in the builder.
The build inventory records OGR's loaded GDAL version and the builder's compiler
and Debian package inventory. No PyArrow dependency is needed.

For local development, install GDAL 3.10.x with NumPy support using your native
package manager (for example, conda-forge), then install `.[dev]`. The batch
reader uses OGR's NumPy stream for selected attributes only; it excludes geometry,
holds at most one 4,096-row batch, and preserves the existing default styling.
The visited-row limit remains unchanged; the native stream may prefetch the
remainder of the final batch when checking whether more rows exist.

For a deployment report, retrieve the installed Python/native versions and build
inputs without starting the app (replace `IMAGE` with the image being inspected):

```sh
docker run --rm --network none --entrypoint cat IMAGE /app/build-environment.json
```

Keep the deployed image and its Git revision for rollback. Recorded input hashes
do not promise byte-identical images; OS package repositories can change between
builds.

## Operations notes

- Keep all secrets out of browser-facing configuration and logs.
- Verify the source mount from a running container with
  `grep ' /scan-source ' /proc/self/mountinfo`; the mount options should begin
  with `ro`.
- Use **Status** and **Rendering diagnostics** before increasing memory, CPU, or
  render concurrency.
- Deleting the volume named by `EOLAB_DATABASE_VOLUME_NAME` permanently deletes
  the Catalog. Do this only when intentionally creating a new empty Catalog.
- Catalog-vector selections read the original mounted source. The web application,
  Processing worker and Job service need the same read-only source mount.

## Immutable raster inputs

Treat every cataloged raster as immutable for its catalog lifetime. Do not overwrite
its data, grid, or embedded metadata in place. This also applies while jobs are
queued, executing, or recoverable, and across deployments that retain those jobs.
Publish changed data as a new asset with a new catalog identity; keep old sources
available until their jobs and recovery lifetimes have ended.

Raster operations authorize the catalog item and resolve its path inside the
configured mount. They do not compare filesystem timestamps or source signatures
to detect edits. Missing or unreadable sources still fail during resolution or
opening. Stored source identities remain in plans, provenance and cache keys;
changing those records is not a substitute for publishing a new asset. Vector
source checks, job ownership, cancellation and output checksum checks are unchanged.


## Shared annotation layers

In **Map layers**, expand **Annotations**, choose **Create shared** and enter a layer
name and your name. **Share** on that layer copies its code. Other people choose
**Join**, enter the code and a name not already used in
that layer. Creators and joiners have the same controls; there is no facilitator
role or separate session panel.

Everyone sees one combined layer containing all contributors' polygons. Expand
the contributor arrow to see names, colors and polygon counts. **Draw polygon**
adds your own polygon. **Edit** opens your editable polygons and a read-only list
of other contributors' polygons. Under **Annotation style**, **Your polygon color**
changes the fill of all your existing and future polygons in that shared layer
for everyone. New members receive the least-used color from the default palette,
in palette order when tied; the picker accepts any custom color, including one
already used by someone else. Your colors in other shared layers are independent.
The layer legend identifies contributors by name and color. Whole-layer opacity,
fill opacity, outlines, labels, visibility and filters affect only your map.
Copying another layer's style does not change shared contributor colors.
Raster summaries use the combined layer and its current filter.

Finished edits and changes to names or notes are saved locally first, then shared
automatically. Unfinished drawings remain local. Removing a layer from your map
does not delete its shared contents; join again with the same browser credentials
to restore your contribution. **Import GeoJSON** adds a private layer from a file. Their **Share** action creates a
new shared layer. **Export GeoJSON** saves the combined polygons with contributor
names and colors. EOLab exports mark this metadata with `eolabAnnotations: 1` and
per-feature `contributor` and `contributorColor` properties. Reimporting retains
these labels and colors, but never membership or editing rights. Sharing an import
in a new layer makes all its polygons your contribution, using your color there.
Ordinary map links do not carry annotations, codes or private credentials.

Shared layers have no automatic expiration. They are stored in the existing
PostgreSQL database under `shared_annotation_layers`; back up that database to
preserve them. No new container or environment variable is required. This version
adds a nullable color column to current memberships automatically; older members
without saved colors receive a stable palette color derived from their membership
ID until they choose another color. Existing polygons are not rewritten. This version
does not migrate or display the former `annotation_sessions` records; existing
local polygon copies remain available. Future administrative cleanup is tracked
separately.

Limits remain 10 memberships per browser, 100 shared layers per site, 64
contributors per shared layer, 8 MiB per contributor, 32 MiB per shared layer and
256 MiB of shared polygon JSON per site. Each contributor can provide up to 500
polygons, with 2,000 vertices per polygon and no holes. Metadata refreshes every
five seconds and backs off to 30 seconds after failures. Only changed peer
contributions transfer polygon data. Interrupted uploads retry the same revision;
conflicting edits in another tab preserve the local copy and report the conflict.

Membership uses an automatically generated Secure, HttpOnly, same-site cookie;
only its hash is stored in the database. Serve the application over HTTPS. The
cookie is renewed for one year on use. Clearing cookies or using a different
browser loses access to editing the original contribution: a display name or
join code cannot restore those edit rights. A code permits joining and reading,
but all write authorization comes from the private browser credential. Different
EOLab sites have separate shared layers. Account-based recovery is not provided.
