# Raster calculations

This guide is for people using EOLab to write raster formulas, interpret their
results, and understand the calculation limits.

Use **Summarize** to calculate statistics over a sampling box, a filtered
[vector layer](vector-sampling.md), or an explicitly selected whole raster.
Open it from **Analysis → Summarize** in the right dock, the right-side map
opener when the dock is closed, or a layer/histogram shortcut. The dock heading
identifies the active task; its context line shows the summary's raster bindings
and selected area. Switching tools preserves each tool's own context.
Incoming point/area inspection remains under **Map click results**, with updating,
unavailable and new-result feedback visible even when that disclosure is collapsed.
**Tools** opens one shared list of analysis, export and map-display actions. Its
button appears in the dock while open and on the map when the dock is closed;
press Escape or click outside the list to dismiss it.
Each of the five available cards has a name, formula, raster binding (`a`),
and result. Different cards can use different rasters, but each formula uses
only one raster. **Formula reference** in the panel lists the supported functions.

Calculations read **native pixels**, not histogram samples or COG overviews.
Raster styling, opacity and a simplified map outline do not change the result.

## Running and saving a calculation

Edit a formula or choose an **Add statistic** preset. Formula checks wait for a
700 ms pause in typing. Invalid formulas show an explanation. **Calculate** can
submit immediately without waiting for this editor feedback; submission validates
the complete request on the server. Unchecked formulas submit individually so an
invalid card cannot reject a valid neighbor. Checked formulas on the same raster
can share a scan. Changing only the raster or area reuses the editor feedback.
Opening the panel or renaming a card does not run it.

From a histogram, **Summarize this area** opens the cards and runs all configured
valid statistics over that area. The first card
uses that histogram's raster; other cards keep their raster bindings. If no area
has been selected, the result position says **Click the map to calculate**. Click
the map to select a sampling box; the automatic-update policy below then applies.

**Update statistics automatically**, beside the summary's area controls, is on by default.
With Summarize active, a new map box can update statistics automatically.
Each calculation is submitted as one job. The worker prepares the raster grid
and work estimates, then immediately calculates the result. Progress changes
from queued to preparing to calculating; prepared estimates remain available
on the job. Server work and memory limits still apply. Use **Calculate** to run
manually, or cancel work that is taking too long.

If another request is already calculating the same source, area and formulas,
your request shares that work. Your status, formula labels and downloads remain
your own. Cancelling your request does not cancel someone else's calculation.

A previous value is grayed out while its replacement is pending. Use the copy
button beside a current value to copy it. **Value details & downloads** contains
coverage, method, CSV and provenance. Missing data can produce a completed job
with no numeric result; the states below explain why.

Changing the active calculation cancels obsolete work. Closing or switching away
from the panel cancels automatic work; manually submitted work can continue in
**Summarize → Previous calculation results**. Keep the same browser session to recover jobs after
reload. A shared map link does not grant access to another person's jobs.
If submission is uncertain, use **Recover / retry** instead of creating a second
request. Exported names and formulas describe the submitted calculation even if
you later edit its card.

## Plotting statistics across rasters

Open **Raster series** from **Tools** or a raster histogram. Use the raster
checklist to choose the rasters to calculate. There is one formula workflow,
with no fixed raster-count limit.
By default, checked rasters follow map-layer visibility, including layers you
turn back on after running a stack. Checking or unchecking a raster in this
checklist keeps that choice through visibility changes and map clicks; hidden
rasters can still be calculated. Removing a layer clears its checklist override.
The same formulas run independently on each raster's native grid, over the
current sampling area or each raster's whole extent. This does not align rasters
or perform pixel-by-pixel arithmetic between different rasters.

Choose **Change area** to use the existing Summary statistics controls for a
map box, filtered vector layer, or annotation polygons (including imported
GeoJSON). **Plot this area across rasters** returns to the series panel.
Drawing a new map box while Raster series is active replaces its calculations.

Add up to five formulas. Within each formula, `a` means the current raster in
the stack. Those formulas share one job per raster. Area reductions share a
read/mask pass; `pixelValue(a)` reads the exact clicked cell.
Each statistic starts visible in **Plot 1**. Its checkbox shows or hides it;
the colored line and marker identify it on the graph. **Add plot** creates another
plot beside the first. Choose a plot beside each statistic to group related values
or separate different units and ranges. Removing a plot moves its statistics back
to Plot 1. Scroll horizontally to reach more plots in a narrow panel.

Each plot has its own **Linear / Log** Y-axis control. Log plots omit zero and
negative values and report how many were omitted. Units come from calculation
results; unspecified or mixed units are labeled explicitly. Hover a line to see its
statistic and formula; hover or keyboard-focus a point to see the full raster name
and all visible values at that position. Focus a legend entry to highlight its line.
Missing values and failed rasters leave gaps; the table explains their status.
Previous plots are faded while replacements are pending. Visibility, plot assignment,
axis scale, names, chart type and display order change without recalculating.

Committed area changes, raster selections, and reopening an unfinished area plot
start calculations immediately. Formula edits wait for a 700 ms pause. Each selected raster
retains an independent calculation; submissions ready together travel in one HTTP
batch of up to 50 rasters. Larger stacks use additional batches without dropping
rasters. No preliminary formula-validation request is needed. Submission errors appear in
the panel; an identical error affecting the whole stack is shown once above the
results. Correct the formula or choose **Calculate** to retry.
The server queues one job per raster, including preparation and execution. Results appear as they finish; the
table shows each raster's progress or error. Summary cards can run alongside a
series. If the job queue is full, affected rasters show
**Waiting for server capacity; retrying automatically**. They remain pending
until space becomes available or you cancel. Retries respect the server's wait
advice and back off; they do not increase server execution concurrency. Storage exhaustion, invalid inputs,
and execution failures remain explicit errors; **Calculate** retries failed rows.
Changing inputs, leaving area series, or **Cancel remaining** cancels outstanding
series work without cancelling summary cards or downloads. After a page reload,
each unfinished series job is recovered only to cancel it safely; the unsaved
stack is not restarted. Lost submission responses retain their original request
keys. **Recover** retries those requests without creating duplicate jobs.

**Values & download** shows every statistic, including hidden or log-excluded values, and exports all formulas,
exact scalar values, units, source IDs, area descriptors, job IDs and cache
status and pixel location as CSV. Formula choices and series results are not saved
in shared map links.

## Language and numerical meaning

Aliases start with a letter, contain letters/digits/underscores, and have at most
32 characters. One binding is allowed. Function names and keywords are reserved.
Within one API submission, labels must be unique and at most 80 characters.
The UI can submit same-named cards separately. Expressions together have a
4 KiB UTF-8 limit and 256 syntax nodes, with nesting/tree depth limited to 20.

Formulas support finite numeric literals, the bound
raster alias, parentheses, unary `+`/`-`, arithmetic `+ - * /`, comparisons
`< <= > >= == !=`, and boolean `! && ||`. Precedence is unary, multiplication and
division, addition and subtraction, ordered comparisons, equality, AND, then OR.
Arithmetic/comparisons require numbers; boolean operators require conditions.
Strings, paths, URLs, property access, indexing, assignment, arbitrary function
calls, and executable Python are unsupported.

Every calculation must yield a numeric scalar and reference its raster. Pixel
expressions go inside an aggregate; aggregates cannot nest. Arithmetic between
aggregate results is allowed, for example `max(a) - min(a)`.

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `pixelValue(a)` | Stored native value at the last map click, independent of the selected area |
| `count(a)` | Count valid selected native cells, including zero |
| `count(a > 10)` or `sum(a > 10)` | Count cells satisfying the condition |
| `sum(a, where=a > 10)` | Sum original values of the matching cells |
| `mean(a * 2, where=a >= 0)` | Pixel-weighted mean of the transformed matching values |
| `stdev(a)` / `stdev(a * 2, where=a >= 0)` | Population standard deviation of valid selected values / transformed matching values |
| `min(a)` / `max(a)` | Smallest / largest selected valid value |
| `areaha(a == 4)` | Ground hectares of class 4 intersecting the selection, including boundary fractions |
| `100 * areaha(a > 10) / areaha(a == a)` | Percentage of valid selected ground area satisfying the condition |

`pixelValue` takes exactly the raster alias, with no `where` or inner expression.
Click the map first to supply its exact WGS84 location. The containing native
cell is read at full resolution, without interpolation. NoData, a nonfinite
value or a point outside the raster returns `no_valid_data`. It does not search
for a nearby valid cell. A formula containing only pixel values reads at most
one native cell even when Whole raster is selected. In mixed formulas such as
`pixelValue(a) - mean(a)`, the point value is independent of the area while
`mean` still uses the selected box, polygons or whole raster. These formulas
use the same submission, worker, cancellation, recovery and result cache.

`areaha` requires exactly one boolean pixel expression and does not accept `where`.
Area numeric functions' optional `where` takes a boolean pixel expression. `mean`, `stdev`, `min`, and `max` take numbers;
`sum` and `count` also accept a condition. Scalar literals within a pixel aggregate
broadcast over valid source cells. Scale/offset metadata is recorded but **not
automatically applied**: calculations use the stored values, matching the current
analysis value domain. Users can explicitly write `a * 2 - 1`. No expression-unit
inference is claimed; the grid's unit is source metadata, not a computed result unit.
A direct `areaha(...)` result explicitly carries `unit: ha`; compound scalar
expressions leave `unit` null, including percentages and user conversions.

By default, each source block is read once, then evaluated in tiles of at most
256 × 256 cells (64 × 64 only for grids requiring individual pixel geometry).
Opt-in batching can combine those reads and enlarge evaluation tiles as described
below. Integers are converted exactly from the supported native integer types to
float64 for pixel arithmetic. Numeric sums use float64 block sums with compensated
combination across blocks; means use scaled block means and weighted combination.
`stdev` divides by the matching pixel count (population semantics, `ddof=0`),
using centered tile moments merged with a fixed origin and scaled differences.
It retains only scalar moments between tiles, without collecting the full raster
or subtracting squared raw values. One matching pixel or constant matching values
give zero; no matches give null (`no_matches`), and an empty/all-NoData selection
gives null (`no_valid_data`). Masked and nonfinite pixels are excluded; arithmetic
errors in its argument or `where` use the same diagnostics as other aggregates.
There is no sample-standard-deviation variant.
Floating results are not arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic. Count reductions
remain integer accumulators. All returned values are decimal **strings** with
`valueType: integer | float`, preserving integer counts across JSON/JavaScript.

Numeric aggregates include cells whose centers fall within the selected area.
Holes are respected; overlapping polygons count once.
`areaha` instead measures each matching native cell's intersection with the polygon selection/box
on the WGS84 ellipsoid, preserving fractional boundary cells, holes, and unioned
overlaps. A sliver can have positive area without containing any pixel center.
These are distinct from clipping's all-touched export mask. EPSG:3857 pixel
dimensions are not ground hectares. See [ground-area methods and limits](ground-area-calculations.md).

Source nodata, nonfinite values, and cells outside the selected area are missing,
never zero. Arithmetic/domain errors invalidate the affected cell in that
aggregate. All operands must be valid, including both operands of boolean OR;
there is no short-circuit recovery from missing data. Partially valid calculations
still produce a result and report excluded arithmetic cells. Each row includes
per-aggregate `validPixels` (source-valid selected cells), `matchedPixels` (included
cells after expression validity/condition), and `invalidArithmeticPixels`.
For `areaha`, these diagnostics count cells with positive intersection; they are
not hectare totals. NoData contributes neither area nor numeric values.

| State | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `ok` | Finite result; coverage diagnostics may report excluded arithmetic cells |
| `no_matches` | Valid data exists but nothing matches: count/sum/areaha is zero, mean/stdev/min/max is null |
| `no_valid_data` | No valid source cell in the area: null, including count |
| `invalid_arithmetic` | All eligible source cells have invalid expression arithmetic, or final scalar arithmetic is undefined: null |
| `overflow` | A numeric accumulation or final scalar result overflows: null |

Missing aggregate operands propagate to the final scalar result. Nonempty scalar
combinations keep `ok`; `no_matches` propagates when every aggregate reports it.
A job can finish `ready` with null-valued rows: the result explains what happened.
CSV stores label, expression, value, value_type, state, and unit; potentially executable
spreadsheet text is escaped. Provenance retains original expressions, the selected area or Catalog descriptor,
source signature, native grid, value/inclusion policies, typed rows,
coverage, creation time, and the CSV checksum.
Area provenance also retains `grid.groundArea` and `functionInclusion`, distinguishing
numeric centers from fractional area intersections.
Pixel calculations additionally retain `pixelPoint` and their clicked-cell
inclusion rule. API submissions using `pixelValue` require
`pixelPoint: {longitude, latitude}`; the field is absent for ordinary area
calculations, and existing saved requests keep their identities.

## Limits

| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Native decoded source work | 4 GiB, at most 65,536 blocks, with conservative preallocation guard |
| Estimated native/expression working memory | 512 MiB within each native process's configured memory ceiling (default 2 GiB) |
| Retained feature / projected-coordinate buffer | 500,000 positions |
| Area polygon-cell work / execution transformations | 2,000,000 fallback cells / 4,000,000 positions; supported rectilinear grids use no pixel polygons |
| Area geometry memory estimate | Additional 128 MiB within the same 512 MiB admission ceiling |
| Working/result reservation | 12 MiB per calculation job |
| Preparation / complete job | 15-second preparation deadline within the 10-minute job deadline |
| Result lifetime | Existing 24-hour lifetime and transfer leases |

A work-limit refusal asks for a smaller area or batch; it never substitutes
coarser pixels. Original raster and vector sources must remain available and
unchanged until the job finishes. Failed or cancelled work does not publish a
partial CSV. See [ground-area calculations](ground-area-calculations.md) for
additional area-method limits and [clip storage](raster-clips.md#storage-and-limits)
for result retention.


### Direct Peru/Brazil sum benchmark

From a checkout with Python 3.12+ and the EOLab dependencies installed, run:

```console
python run_raster_vector_sum_benchmark.py
```

The defaults use the 2018 human-footprint COG in
`D:/wwf-connectivity/processed/human-footprint/` and
`D:/easy_to_find_data_i_always_use/countries_without_antarctica.gpkg`.
The script selects `iso3 == PER OR iso3 == BRA`, requires exactly two features,
and calls the application's `selection_summary`, `plan_aggregate`, and
`calculate_raster_statistics_for_area` for `sum(a)`. It uses the native pixel grid,
source validity mask, cell-center polygon inclusion, normal work limits and default read/tile
sizes. It does not contain its own clipping or summing algorithm.

Use explicit inputs on another machine, and redirect the JSON report to save a baseline:

```console
python run_raster_vector_sum_benchmark.py --raster /scan-source/human-footprint/human-footprint_hfp_2018_wgs84_cog.tif --vector /scan-source/countries_without_antarctica.gpkg --repeat 3 > sum-baseline.json
```

Adjust the mounted paths to match the installation; `--layer` overrides the
default `countries_without_antarctica` native layer name. Progress goes to stderr.
Input files are read-only, and temporary kernel artifacts are deleted after each
run. Ctrl+C interrupts the direct calculation.

The report includes the result, CSV checksum, file identities, grid, limits,
library versions, checkout revision and harness wall times. Each repetition plans and
executes again; caches are not cleared, so a first repetition is not necessarily
cold. Compare identical inputs and grids: the local default COG is WGS84 whereas
the current Connectivity deployment uses a Web Mercator copy.

This is an offline kernel benchmark. It supplies explicit local file capabilities
in place of Catalog lookup and job submission. It does not measure authorization,
HTTP, queueing, worker startup, notifications or browser display. Measurement
lives in this standalone harness; the application does not collect profiling
data. Import time is reported separately.


### Large polygon selections

If a calculation reports a polygon memory limit, filter the vector layer to fewer
features to stay within the calculation's memory budget.
EOLab keeps the original polygon detail; it does not simplify analysis geometry.

Polygon summaries also need temporary disk space for a mask, approximately one
byte per pixel in the selected raster window plus file overhead. If storage is
insufficient, select a smaller area or free space on the Processing data volume.
Temporary mask files are deleted automatically.

After upgrading, an older queued job may need more disk space than it originally
reserved. If the job reports insufficient reserved space, run the calculation again.

## Batch submission API

`POST /api/processing/raster-calculations/batch` accepts `{"items": [...]}`,
with 1–50 complete single-calculation request objects. Each retains its own
`requestId`. The envelope is limited to 801 KiB before JSON parsing, and each
item's compact UTF-8 JSON to 16 KiB. The existing same-origin Processing header
and owner cookie apply. The single-calculation endpoint remains available.

A valid envelope returns HTTP 200 and one `items` entry per input, identified by
its zero-based `index`. An entry contains either `job` (the normal owned job
snapshot) or `error` with `status`, `code`, `message`, and nullable
`retryAfterSeconds`. Invalid items do not prevent valid neighbors from being
admitted. Envelope/origin errors reject the request. Unexpected transaction
failure rolls back its accepted inserts; a lost response remains uncertain, so
clients retry with the original per-item keys. A retry returns the accepted job
even if the queue filled or its temporary polygon upload expired afterward.

Admission borrows one pooled connection, takes the shared lock once, reads retry
and work identities together, and reads capacity counts once. It updates those
counts for each acceptance before batching job/subscriber inserts and committing.
Uploaded polygon areas are resolved once per distinct reference before that
transaction, using their existing ownership boundary. The lock is not held while
resolving inputs or running native work. There is no batch scheduler or batch job:
existing workers, fairness, deduplication, SSE/status observation, and per-job
cancellation still apply. Browser executors retain accepted handles and retry
only capacity-rejected items; failed transport retains keys for explicit recovery.


### Worker scratch preparation

Scratch preparation checks the filesystem's available space against the job's
reservation plus the physical free-space floor, then creates its private attempt
directory. It does not traverse or total retained result files. Database
reservations continue to govern concurrent admission, and publication checks
the completed attempt against its own reservation. Existing cleanup still
removes expired and orphaned files; it is not needed to calculate a volume-wide
byte total before each job.
